# webWindow
The webWindow package allows you to take _any_ html element and put it in a virtual window with two lines of javascript: 
```
var element = document.getElementById("your-elements-id");
newWindObj(element,"window-title"); 
```
see [this example](http://coderman64.github.io/webWindow/test.html)

##pros
